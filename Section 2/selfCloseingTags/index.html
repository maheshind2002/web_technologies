<h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br /> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br /> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br /> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,<br /> remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release<br /> of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing<br /> software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
Where does it come from?</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots<br /> in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.<br /> Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up<br /> one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, <br />and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable <br />source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"<br /> (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on<br /> the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,<br /> "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
